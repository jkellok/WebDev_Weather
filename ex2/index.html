        <h2>The Hand</h2>
        <p>Each player has 13 tiles in their hand and at the start of their turn they draw a tile from the wall.
            The player temporarily has 14 tiles and if the player doesn't declare a win, they must discard one tile
            from their hand.<br>The winning hand consists of four sets of three tiles and a pair (3+3+3+3+2=14). The winning hand must also
            have a valid yaku, which is like a winning condition.
        </p>
        <h4>Different sets of tiles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Sequence</b> consists of three consecutive tiles of the same suit, for example 4-5-6 or 7-8-9.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Triplet</b> consists of three of the same tile, for example 2-2-2 or three dragons.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Quads</b> are usually called kan. A kan consist of four of the same tiles. It needs to be declared to form a part of a winning hand.
                When declared, the player receives an extra tile from the dead wall because otherwise they would have one tile less.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Calling tiles</h4>
        <p>The player can also call other players discards when the tile is discarded. The player must form a set with the tile and display it face up on the table.
            This makes the hand an open hand, which can lessen the value of the hand.<br> Players can also choose not to call tiles and keep their hand closed.
            That player continues the game and must discard a tile from their hand. There are different calls.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Chii</b> is called out when a player can make a sequence with the discarded tile.<br> The discard must be from the player before their turn i.e. from the left player
                because the turns go anticlockwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Pon</b> is called out when a player can make a triplet with the discarded tile.<br> The discard can be from any player. If two players
                want the same discard, pon has precedence.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Kan</b> is called when the player has four identical tiles.<br> Open quad is when the kan is formed of another player's discard.
                <br>You can make an added open quad by adding a tile from your own hand to your pon.<br> You can also have a closed quad. In this case
                all the four tiles are from your hand. This does not make the hand open.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Winning</h2>
        <p>When player is one tile from winning, the hand is said to be in tenpai. The player only needs one tile to declare their win. <br>If they win
            on other player's discard, they call "<i>ron</i>" and reveal their hand. The player who discarded the tile must pay the winner the amount of points that
            the winning hand is worth.<br> If they win by drawing the winning tile, the player calls "<i>tsumo</i>" and reveals their hand. All the other players must
            pay the winner. The pay is shared, for example if the hand is worth 3000 points, the players each pay 1000 points to the winner.
        </p>
        <h4>Yaku</h4>
        <p>The winning hand must have a yaku. Yaku is determined by the shape of the hand or different conditions. Each yaku has its own han value.
            Hands worth 1 han are easier to get than hands worth multiple han.<br> In some cases an open hand will get -1 han (2 han - 1 = 1 han). Yakuman is a value for
            hands that are very hard to get. Yakuman hands ignore normal scoring patterns.
            <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong_yaku">The Wikipedia article</a> has a good and a comprehensive list of different yaku. <a href="https://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/mahjong/mahjong_e.html">Here</a> is another site with basic rules and a list of yaku.
            <br>Riichi is one of the easiest ways to get a yaku and it has specific rules. You can declare that your hand is ready when you are in tenpai and your hand is closed.<br>
            You have to call "<i>riichi</i>" and deposit 1000 points. You can't change your hand anymore so you have to discard all the tiles you draw if it's not your winning tile.
        </p>
        <h2>Playing the game</h2>
        <p>Before the game starts, seating of players is determined by honor tiles and a pair of dice. Players' positions are called wind direction seats.
            <br>East seat becomes the dealer. Games usually last 2 rounds. First round is called East round and second is South round. Round ends when each player has been a dealer.<br>
            If the dealer wins or is in tenpai when the match ends in a draw, they stay as the dealer. When the dealer wins, they get double points.<br>
            Dice are also used to determine where the wall is broken and where the tiles are dealt from. When the tiles are dealt, the 14 tiles left from the broken part become the dead wall.<br>
            Dead wall is used for extra tiles for kan and for the dora indicators. Third tile is flipped open and this tile is called the dora indicator. The next tile in the suit becomes a dora.<br>
            For example, if the dora indicator is 3-man, the dora is 4-man. Having a dora in your hand gives you more points but it is not a yaku. When a player calls kan, another dora indicator is flipped.<br>
        </p>

        <p>The dealer starts and players take turns drawing and discarding tiles and calling on discards. The match ends when someone declares a winning hand or when the match ends in a draw.<br>
            The one with most points at the end of the game (after last match in South round) wins the whole game.<br>
            Mahjong rules can also vary depenging on players' preferences and where it's played.
